Bugs:
- When trying to test getCost, I encountered a segfault. This could have been because
  of bad testing parameters, however.

Coverage:
- I was able to reach about 26% test coverage in my tests.
- This is a very alarming figure considering only 8 functions were directly tested.
  It tells us that the code is very tightly coupled, because over a quarter of the 
  code is being run by calling these 8 functions.

Impressions:
- Unit testing this program is very difficult. This is because the code is not well 
  documented, which makes it difficult to know exactly what parameters a certain
  function should take, what assumptions are made about the arguments, and what
  the function should return.
- Testing this code is interesting. It is like spell checking a thesis written 
  in another language. Sometimes you have to assert basic principles of a 
  function just to learn what you should actually be testing.
