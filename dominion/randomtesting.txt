adventurer:
	To develop the random test of this card, I randomized the gamestate's

	I had a lot of trouble testing this function due to segfaults. I was able to use gdb to run a backtrace on the function,
	and found that the segfault was occurring when it "discards all cards in play that have been drawn".

council_room:
	I was able to achieve 100% coverage for this function.

smithy:
	This function had not been refactored, and was still in the large switch statement in cardEffect.
