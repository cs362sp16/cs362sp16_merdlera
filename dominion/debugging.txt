There was a bug in the refactored implementation of cardAdventurer(). Almost 50% of the time,
calling this function would result in a segmentation fault. This bug was exposed by the random
tester written for Assigment 4. In order to fix this bug, I used gdb to follow the trace back to the
pointer error. The bug was caused by attempting to access an array out of bounds on line 34.

Some of Agans' Principles that were used were:
  - Change one thing at a time: Only altered one line at a time and tested one input at a time in gdb.
  - Keep an audit trail: Used git to track progress.
  - Get a fresh view: Left for 20 minutes, then returned to find the bug source.
